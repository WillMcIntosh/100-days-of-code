# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: December 5, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: I've finished my portfolio project on Free Code Camp. I also followed along with JS30 by Wes Bos to make a clock in CSS and JavaScript.

**Thoughts** I'm pretty happy with the way everything turned out with my portfolio page. I linked a few projects from classes in the portfolio section. The clock was a cool exercise. I learned a little more CSS with `transform-origin:` and `transition-timing-function:`.

### Day 2: December 6, Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: The internet was down but I managed to watch some Shiffman Coding Train videos and have a good time being confused about recursion while playing in p5.js with fractals. 

**Thoughts**: I think I made a few infinite loops and still didn't figure out how to stop drawing. I think my first tree was continuously drawing branches over and over. I think I understand the basics of recursion but I really want to be able to randomize the angle of branches and change thickness.

### Day 3: December 7, Thurssday

**Today's Progress**: Another day without internet, which is apparently my lifeline to any and all knowledge. I watched a few Coding Train videos on my phone while I waited for Comcast. Hopefully I will have an update with some work later tonight.

**Thoughts**: I do think I gained valuable knowledge of ES6 arrow functions and also the `this` keyword in JavaScript, so the day wasn't totally a wash. However, I want to play around maybe in JS tonight and implement what I learned today to show progress.

### Day 4: December 8, Friday

**Today's Progress**: The internet is back! I started the day off doing the JS30 exercise on CSS variables, then reviewed some Python. I then went through the FCC basic algorithms that I had solved in JS and did them again in Python. 

**Thoughts**: Using CSS variables is interesting. I could do this to make some interactive parts of web pages without using much JS at all. Unlike SASS which defines CSS variables at compile time that cannot be changed later, changing the variables in JS allows them to be changed wherever they are referenced on the page.

### Day 5: December 9, Saturday

**Today's Progress**: Leetcode practice problems in python. 

**Thoughts**: It took me a while to refamiliarize myself with python syntax, and I also think I need to review data structures because I'm not as comfortable as I'd like to be yet.

### Day 6: December 10, Sunday

**Today's Progress**: Worked to remove inline styling from React App for Code for Boston.

**Thoughts**: I learned a little about the ways React can handle styling. We went with style objects that we just call into the few pages that needed unique styles.

### Day 7: December 11, Monday

**Today's Progress**: Playing around in JS30 after doing the Array Cardio lecture. 

**Thoughts**: I feel like this helped me to understand objects and arrays in JS much better.

### Day 8: December 12, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: Mostly spent today learning PHP, although I took a little time to go over the styling again for Code for Boston. 

**Thoughts**: PHP is interesting and I look forward to being able to deliver a working prototype of a sign up form soon.

### Day 9: December 13, Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: More PHP, and finally submitted my PR for inline styling removal.

**Thoughts**: Not the most productive day. I feel like I spent most of my time searching for solutions today.

### Day 10: December 14, Thursday

**Today's Progress**: Today I did the HackerRank World CodeSprint 12. I finished the easy challenge but couldn't get any of the medium ones. I felt like I had good solutions but I kept timing out. 

**Thoughts**: I really think I need to learn Data Structures and Algorithms to be able to pass these challenges with more than just lists and arrays.

### Day 11: December 15, Friday

**Today's Progress**: More attempts at HackerRank World CodeSprint 12. 

**Thoughts**: I've got to be missing something really fundamental.

### Day 12: December 16, Saturday

**Today's Progress**: LeetCode Weekly Contest 63

**Thoughts**: I did alright. I got one of the challenges and then again had the idea right on another but couldn't quite get it to solve correctly.

### Day 13: December 17, Sunday

**Today's Progress**: React for Beginners with Wes Bos.

**Thoughts**: I decided I really need to know React well so I purchased the course and dove in. I'm liking it so far.

### Day 14: December 18, Monday

**Today's Progress**: React for Beginners with Wes Bos, again. Reviewed LeetCode problems from contest.

**Thoughts**: I really overcomplicated one of the problems that I couldn't get right. Learned about React components and added a few things to my page.
