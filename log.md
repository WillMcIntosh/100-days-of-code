# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: December 5, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: I've finished my portfolio project on Free Code Camp. I also followed along with JS30 by Wes Bos to make a clock in CSS and JavaScript.

**Thoughts** I'm pretty happy with the way everything turned out with my portfolio page. I linked a few projects from classes in the portfolio section. The clock was a cool exercise. I learned a little more CSS with `transform-origin:` and `transition-timing-function:`.

### Day 2: December 6, Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: The internet was down but I managed to watch some Shiffman Coding Train videos and have a good time being confused about recursion while playing in p5.js with fractals. 

**Thoughts**: I think I made a few infinite loops and still didn't figure out how to stop drawing. I think my first tree was continuously drawing branches over and over. I think I understand the basics of recursion but I really want to be able to randomize the angle of branches and change thickness.
