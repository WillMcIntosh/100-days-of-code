# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: December 5, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: I've finished my portfolio project on Free Code Camp. I also followed along with JS30 by Wes Bos to make a clock in CSS and JavaScript.

**Thoughts** I'm pretty happy with the way everything turned out with my portfolio page. I linked a few projects from classes in the portfolio section. The clock was a cool exercise. I learned a little more CSS with `transform-origin:` and `transition-timing-function:`.
